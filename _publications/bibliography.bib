	author={Polydoros, Athanasios S and Nalpantidis, Lazaros},
	abstract={Reinforcement learning is an appealing approach for allowing robots to learn new tasks. Relevant literature reveals a plethora of methods, but at the same time makes clear the lack of implementations for dealing with real life challenges. Current expectations raise the demand for adaptable robots. We argue that, by employing model-based reinforcement learning, the—now limited—adaptability characteristics of robotic systems can be expanded. Also, model-based reinforcement learning exhibits advantages that makes it more applicable to real life use-cases compared to model-free methods. Thus, in this survey, model-based methods that have been applied in robotics are covered. We categorize them based on the derivation of an optimal policy, the definition of the returns function, the type of the transition model and the learned task. Finally, we discuss the applicability of model-based reinforcement learning approaches in new applications, taking into consideration the state of the art in both algorithms and hardware.},

  title={Accurate and versatile automation of industrial kitting operations with {SkiROS},},
  abstract={The low automation level of industrial manufacturing processes, in conjunction with the limited research in the field of object manipulation for placing tasks, rise the need for adaptive and accurate industrial robotic systems that can manipulate a variety of objects in an uncertain environment. We deal with those issues by providing insights into two modules of a skilled-based architecture, the SkiROS. Those modules are applied on the placing part of an industrial kitting operation and can lead to versatile perception of the environment and the accurate placing of objects in confined areas. We evaluate both modules in terms of accuracy, execution time and success rate in various setups of the environment. Also we evaluate the whole kitting pipeline – including the proposed modules – as a unit in terms of repeatability and execution time. The results show that the proposed system is capable to both accurately localize the kitting box and place the object in its narrow compartments.},

	abstract={The robotics industry has introduced light-weight compliant manipulators to increase the safety during human-robot interaction. This characteristic is achieved by replacing the stiff actuators of the traditional robots with compliant ones which creates challenges in the analytical derivation of the dynamics models. Those mainly derive from physics-based methods and thus they are based on physical properties which are hard to be calculated.  In this thesis, is presented, a novel online machine learning approach  which is able to model both inverse and forward dynamics models of industrial manipulators. The proposed method belongs to the class of deep learning and exploits the concepts of self-organization, recurrent neural networks and iterative multivariate Bayesian regression. It has been evaluated on multiple datasets captured from industrial robots while they were performing various tasks. Also, it was compared with multiple other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the thesis presents the application of the proposed learning method on robot control for achieving trajectory execution while learning the inverse dynamics models  on-the-fly . Also it is presented the application of the forward dynamics models on a model-based reinforcement learning scheme},

	title={Ski{ROS}—A Skill-Based Robot Control Platform on Top of {ROS}},
        abstract={The development of cognitive robots in ROS still lacks the support of some key components: a knowledge integration framework and a framework for autonomous mission execution. In this research chapter, we will discuss our skill-based platform SkiROS, that was developed on top of ROS in order to organize robot knowledge and its behavior. We will show how SkiROS offers the possibility to integrate different functionalities in form of skill ‘apps’ and how SkiROS offers services for integrating these skill-apps into a consistent workspace. Furthermore, we will show how these skill-apps can be automatically executed based on autonomous, goal-directed task planning. SkiROS helps the developers to program and port their high-level code over a heterogeneous range of robots, meanwhile the minimal Graphical User Interface (GUI) allows non-expert users to start and supervise the execution. As an application example, we present how SkiROS was used to vertically integrate a robot into the manufacturing system of PSA Peugeot-Citroën. We will discuss the characteristics of the SkiROS architecture which makes it not limited to the automotive industry but flexible enough to be used in other application areas as well. SkiROS has been developed on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and ROS indigo and it can be downloaded at https://github.com/frovida/skiros. A demonstration video is also available at https://youtu.be/mo7UbwXW5W0.},

  title={Global Localization for Future Space Exploration Rovers},
  abstract={In the context of robotic space exploration the problem of autonomous global or absolute localization remains unsolved. Current rovers require human in the loop approaches to acquire global positioning. In this paper we assess this problem by refining our previous work in a way that advances the performance of the system while making the procedure feasible for real implementation on rovers. A map of semantic landmarks (the Global Network - GN) is extracted on an area that the rover traverses prior to the mission and, during the exploration, a Local Network (LN) is built and matched to estimate rover’s global location. We have optimized several aspects of the system: the motion estimation, the detection and classification –by benchmarking several classifiers– and we have tested the system in a Mars like scenario. With the aim to achieve realistic terms in our scenario a custom robotic platform was developed, bearing operation features similar to ESA’s ExoMars. Our results indicate that the proposed system is able to perform global localization and converges relatively fast to an accurate solution.},

  abstract={We present a novel, reusable and task-agnostic primitive for assessing the outcome of a force-interaction robotic skill, useful e.g.\ for applications such as quality control in industrial manufacturing. The proposed method is easily programmed by kinesthetic teaching, and the desired adaptability and reusability are achieved by machine learning models. The primitive records sensory data during both demonstrations and reproductions of a movement. Recordings include the end-effector's Cartesian pose and exerted wrench at each time step. The collected data are then used to train Gaussian Processes which create models of the wrench as a function of the robot's pose. The similarity between the wrench models of the demonstration and the movement's reproduction is derived by measuring their Hellinger distance. This comparison creates features that are fed as inputs to a Naive Bayes classifier which estimates the movement's probability of success. The evaluation is performed on two diverse robotic assembly tasks -- snap-fitting and screwing -- with a total of 5 use cases, 11 demonstrations, and more than 200 movement executions. The performance metrics prove the proposed method's capability of generalization to different demonstrations and movements.}

  abstract={Movement primitives have been a very popular approach for learning robot movements from demonstrations. Nevertheless, they usually depend on a large number of hyper-parameters which also may vary depending on the complexity of the demonstration. In this paper, we deal with this challenge by presenting a novel, self-tuned and compact -- in terms of hyper-parameters -- representation of movement primitives. The method models a demonstrated movement by utilizing Gaussian Process (GP) models which are able to learn movements of various complexities with a minimum and fixed number of hyper-parameters. This is achieved by defining the mean function of GP as a PD controller which attracts a movement to the desired state. Furthermore, a locally periodic covariance function is used as kernel which guarantees the stability and can also model complex movements. Additionally we employ multi-task learning on GP for modeling all the robot's joints with a single model which significantly facilitates data-driven learning. The method has been evaluated on its ability to learn and generate movements with various starting states, goal states and execution time horizons. Furthermore, it is compared with DMPs on two manufacturing assembly tasks, namely snap-fitting and screwing where it is found to perform better with 5 and 12 times less hyper-parameters respectively.}

  note={Submitted in Neural Networks},
  year={2018},
  public={yes},
  abstract={Dynamics modeling is crucial in the field of robotics for achieving fundamental operations such as torque-based control, operational-space control and trajectory simulation. Although there exist analytical physics-based approaches, their derivation can be problematic since they require knowledge about the manipulators' physical properties, which can be hard or even impossible to derive. A machine learning alternative is to employ regression approaches for approximating dynamics models exploiting only the sensors' data-streams. Therefore, in this paper is presented a model learning approach, based on Echo-State Networks which can be applied online for learning both inverse and forward dynamics models solely from data. The method exploits the abilities of self-organization, Echo-State Networks and multivariate Bayesian regression. The proposed approach has been implemented within a computed-torque controller on a physical robotic system in order to achieve online learning of inverse dynamics models  and used for executing trajectories. Moreover, it has been evaluated on datasets captured from multiple robotic manipulators and has been compared with other machine learning algorithms. The results -- in the case of inverse dynamics learning -- exhibit state-of-the-art performance on generalization ability, prediction accuracy and convergence while the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of adaptability. In case of forward dynamics modeling it outperforms the prediction accuracy of the state-of-the-art algorithms both on short and long-term predictions.}
