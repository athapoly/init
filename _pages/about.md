I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Learning Algorithms and Sytsems Labarotarory, (LASA)](lasa.epfl.ch), EPFL, Switzerland where I collaborate with [Prof. Aude Billard](http://lasa.epfl.ch/people/member.php?SCIPER=115671). I am involved in both teaching and research activities. Before that, I was with the
 [Intelligent and Interactive Systems Lab](https://iis.uibk.ac.at/start), University of Innsbruck, Austria collaborating with Proff. [Justus Piater](https://www.uibk.ac.at/newsroom/dossiers/neue_gesichter/piater.html). My research field is robot learning for industrial applications focusing on kinesthetic teaching, movement primitives and reinforcement learning. 

I have been awarded a Ph.D. degree from Aalborg University in the field of Robot Learning under the supervision of Prof. [Lazaros Nalpantidis](http://homes.m-tech.aau.dk/lanalpa/) and Prof. [Volker Kr√ºger](http://personprofil.aau.dk/104026). I was a member of the Robotics Vision and Machine Intelligence [RVMI](http://rvmi.aau.dk/) lab of the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering Department. My Ph.D. research was focused on model learning for control of industrial robots.

I was awarded M.Sc degree, with distinction, on Artificial Intelligence form the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), Department of Informatics. My thesis investigated the impact of internal models on self-organised robot controllers and it was supervised by Prof [Michael Herrmann](http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/michael-herrmann(cf1b7c31-3a87-4812-bf0a-05cf49b0120e).html)
          
I also hold a combined B.Sc/M.Sc degree on Production Engineering from Democritus University of Thrace, Greece [DUTH](http://duth.gr/index.en.shtml), Department of Production and Management Engineering. My thesis was on Hebbian learning of fuzzy cognitive maps and it supervised by Prof. George Papakostas and Prof. Dimitrios Koulourioths

Research Interests
======

My main research interest is Machine Learning and its applications on both robot control and cognition. I enjoy developing and applying novel ML algorithms that make robots capable to explore their embodiment and environment while they learn a task. I focus on industrial applications where robots can become capable to learn different manufacturing tasks without the need of re-programming.
My research intersets include:
* Reinforcement Learning
* Movement Primitives
* Model Learning for Control
* Bayesian Methods
* Industrial Robots
