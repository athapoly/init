## Code:

### URmat
 The URmat project is an interface between Matlab and Universal Robots (UR) robotic manipulators. It enables the control of UR robots with Matlab programming over TCP/IP connection. It can be useful for teaching robotics and implementing simple projects. Also URmat can be used alongside with Peter Corke's [Robotics Toolbox](http://petercorke.com/Robotics_Toolbox.html). It has been developed and tested on a UR5 robot with software version 3.0

The code can be found [here](https://git.rvmi.aau.dk/athapoly/urmat) and comes without any guarantee. Developers and testers are welcome!

## Data:

### Inverse Dynamics Datasets:
	  
* BaxterRhythmic -- dynamics generated by a circular movement of the Rethink Baxter robot  
* URpickNplace -- dynamics generated by pick n place of a 5 kg object for the Universal Robots UR10 manipulator  
* BaxterRand -- dynamics generated by point reaching movements of the Rethink Baxter robot  
	
The datasets can be downloaded [here](https://bitbucket.org/athapoly/datasets/src) and made availiale by:  
 {% bibliography -q @*[id=polydoros2015real] %}


### Forward Dynamics Datasets:
			
* KukaDirectDynamics -- 10 trajectories generated from Kuka LWR while executing a pick and place task  
* BaxterDirectDynamics -- 10 trajectories generated from Rethink Baxter  while executing a pick and place task
